Moroccan music uniquely blends Arabic, Amazighi, Andalusian, Mediterranean, and African influences. The well-known Andalusian music, known as *al-'ala*, is popular in Fez, Meknes, Rabat-Salé, Tetouan, and Tangiers. These cities have played a pivotal role in preserving and fostering the art form, contributing to Morocco's rich musical legacy. This musical tapestry showcases the diversity and depth of Morocco's artistic heritage, which continues to be celebrated today.
